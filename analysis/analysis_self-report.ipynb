    "In this notebook, we wil be reading in the UV and then analysing the data according to the following hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- H1:Long form viewing is associated with greater Enjoyment than Short form viewing (our rationale is that emotional engagement and narrative development are enhanced in Long form (i.e., in narrative context), which may increase Enjoyment).\n",
    "- H3:Long form viewing is associated with better Recall than Short form viewing (rationale = contextual information aids memory encoding and retrieval).\n",
    "- H5:Participants who are more Familiar with a Title may report higher Enjoyment than participants who are less familiar (rationale = prior exposure may increase emotional engagement and understanding of the content)\n",
    "- H5:Participants who are more Familiar with a Title may report higher Enjoyment than participants who are less familiar, split by format\n",
    "- H6:Participants who are more Familiar with a Title will show better Recall on average than those who are less familiar (rationale = familiarity may support memory retrieval through mental schema activation).\n",
    "- E5:Is there a positive relationship between Enjoyment and Recall?\n",

    "In addition to testing the hypothesis, we will also be generating visualisations as graphs.\n",

    "Our design was a 2 x 2 between-subjects factorial:\n",
    "- Factor 1 = Format (short form versus long form)\n",
    "- Factor 2 = Familiarity with Title (we used a scale and decided on treating Familiarity as a moderator). The scores used for this will be the Screening questionnaire familiarity\n",
    "- Random factor / variable = Titles / Genres (we're not focusing on specific Title / Genre interactions. Our focus is on the Format effect)."
