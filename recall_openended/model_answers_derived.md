## Abbot Elementary — Long format

In the Abbott Elementary staff break room, several teachers are sitting together eating lunch and arguing about which place has the best pizza. Jacob and the others passionately defend their favorite local spots, while Gregory Eddie is clearly uncomfortable being drawn into the debate. Pressured to name a favorite, Gregory lies and invents an elaborate answer about a special “Baltimore-style” pizza he supposedly loves — described as wet, soggy, almost “sauce-soaked” with a particular crust, something so unusual that no one else has heard of it. The others are skeptical but intrigued enough that one of them actually orders this pizza, or goes out of their way to try and get it. As the moment of truth approaches and the pizza is about to arrive, Gregory panics and finally confesses that he doesn’t like pizza at all and made the whole Baltimore pizza story up to fit in. His colleagues are shocked, confused, and a little horrified by his admission, teasing him for lying and for not liking such a universally loved food. Gregory ends up isolated and embarrassed, leaving the room, while the rest of the staff react dramatically to the revelation.

## Abbot Elementary — Short format

In the Abbott Elementary staff room, the teachers are sharing pizza bought for the staff, when Gregory Eddie’s co-workers notice that he’s dodging actually eating any of it. The colleague who purchased the pizza for the staff then presents him with the pizaa he claims to be his favourite, which the colleague went out of his way to get, and his colleagues press him to take a slice. Under this social pressure, Gregory’s earlier story about a very specific “Baltimore-style” pizza falls apart, as he cant bring himself to take a bite out of this wet, sauce soaked pizza. Cornered, he admits that he doesn’t like pizza at all and has been pretending just to avoid judgment and fit in with everyone else’s enthusiasm. The group is stunned and mildly appalled by the confession, reacting with exaggerated horror, disbelief, and teasing, turning Gregory’s dislike of pizza into both a joke and a small social betrayal within the friend group.

## Mad Max — Long format

In a desolate post-apocalyptic desert, Max is introduced as a lone ranger, who eventually gets caught by raiders. The world is clearly in a post-apocalyptic state where fuel, water, and machines are scarce and worth killing for. Max finds himself taken captive and set up as a blood bag in a cavernous prison type setting. He manages to break free, and tries to make a run for it, only to encounter the complexity of the labrynth he is in and is eventually caught again and chained. In the next seen, Immortan Joe, an evil overlord, announces to the population of starving invalids surrounding his rocky fortress that his Imperator Furiousa is heading out to the oil fields to collect oil. A massive armored tanker known as the War Rig is first lowered onto the ground, and then sets off in convoy, driven by Imperator Furiosa. After making an unexpected turn, a convoy of bizarre, weaponized vehicles closes in on her from all sides. Her convoy which includes war boys loyal to Immortan Joe protect her as they successfully ward off the raider. However, one of Immortan Joes sons who is following the convoy through a telescope notices that Furiousa has taken a turn in the wrong direction. He notices his father, Immortan, who then immediately runs to a vault which he opens and enters, only to find the words 'We will not give birth to warlords' written on the walls. It becomes apparent that Furiosa is secretly transporting precious cargo — fleeing captives or “wives” of immoratn joe— and is trying to escape the control of Immortan Joe. Immortan joe immediately recruits a second convoy to give chase to Furiousa, with the mandate of killing furiousa and bringing back his wives, untouched. One of the war boys, Nux, is desperate to join Immortan Joe on this quest in the hopes of obtaining Valhalla, eternal honor. He is denied participation due to his low blood level, but retorts with the idea to take his blood bag (Max) with him. Thus, Max is strapped to a pole attached to the front of a car, and is driven by Nux in chase of Furiosa, accompanied by many other war boys and Immortan Joe himself. As  The attackers ride in customized death machines covered in spikes and metal, with pale, fanatical War Boys clinging to poles, swinging between cars. They soon catch up with furiousa, and onto the rig in high-speed, acrobatic assaults.  Among the pursuers is Nux, a War Boy who has Max strapped to the front of his car as a living “blood bag,” feeding him blood while they give chase. The sequence unfolds as an extended chase and battle: vehicles crash, flip, and explode; attackers try to board the War Rig; Furiosa fights them off while driving through dangerous terrain and heading toward a looming sandstorm in an attempt to lose her attackers. The chaos escalates with gunfire, harpoons, exploding vehicles, and desperate maneuvers until Furiosa manages to blast and evade enough of the pursuing cars, using the environment and her driving skill to survive and push forward through the storm with the rig still moving. In a final act of supposed valor, Nux tries to blow his vehicle up, including himelf and his blood bag, Max, in hopes that the detonation will slow and destroy Furiousa, but Max manages to stop him in time and instead, the car flips over without detonating.

## Mad Max — Short format

On a vast desert road, the War Rig races at high speed as a pack of ferocious, improvised combat vehicles swarms around it. Furiosa drives the rig while attackers attempt to stop or hijack it, leaping from their own cars and swinging on poles to get onto the tanker. The scene focuses on the intensity of the pursuit and the ferocity of the combat: vehicles ramming each other, shots fired, explosions erupting when cars collide or are hit, and one attacker dramatically leaping from his vehicle with explosives onto an enemy car, causing a huge blast that the others cheer. The key impression is of a brutal, chaotic chase with Furiosa and her allies trying to keep the War Rig moving while a fanatical group of raiders repeatedly attacks and is violently repelled.

## The Town — Long format

In a dense urban neighborhood, a crew of professional robbers prepares and executes a heist on an armored truck outside a bank. Wearing eerie nun masks and dark habits, they move with practiced coordination: they ambush the armored truck, violently subdue or threaten the guard, and quickly transfer bags of cash into their waiting getaway vehicle, a minivan. The robbery escalates into a high-stakes escape as the police respond. The crew tears through narrow city streets, weaving through traffic while a patrol car pursues them. During the chase, the thieves demonstrate clear planning: they navigate to a pre-arranged location, abandon the original van, and switch into another vehicle — often described as a Jeep or SUV — right under the nose of a nearby cop who either glances over or seems not to fully register what’s happening. To erase evidence, they douse the van in gasoline and set it on fire, letting it explode or burn as a distraction while they drive away in the new car. The scene ends with them having escaped the immediate danger, while later investigation and interrogation by law enforcement is implied or briefly shown as the aftermath of the crime.

## The Town — Short format

A small crew of armed robbers in nun masks stages a fast, aggressive robbery of an armored truck near a bank. They jump out of their vehicle, point guns at the guard, and force him to hand over money, stuffing cash into bags and piling it into their minivan. As soon as they have the money, they speed away, triggering a police response and a tense car chase through city streets. The robbers manage to stay just ahead of the pursuing police, then pull off a planned maneuver: they stop in a less visible spot, quickly transfer themselves and the bags of cash into another vehicle, and pour gasoline inside the original van. As they drive off in the new car, they ignite the minivan, causing it to burst into flames, destroying physical evidence and confusing the trail for the police. The key beats are the masked robbery, the rapid getaway, the near-miss with the cops, and the deliberate burning of the first getaway car to secure their escape.

en.wikipedia.org
. Designated a universal blood donor, Max is imprisoned and used as a living “blood bag” transfusion source for a sickly War Boy named Nux (Nicholas Hoult)
en.wikipedia.org
. (Max even attempts a frantic escape through the Citadel’s twisting caves early on, but he is quickly recaptured and chained up again, foreshadowing the struggle to come
en.wikipedia.org
.) Meanwhile, Immortan Joe – who hoards water and rules through terror – dispatches his elite Imperator, Furiosa (Charlize Theron), on a mission to drive a massive armored tanker War Rig to barter for fuel and ammunition with neighboring outposts (Gas Town and the Bullet Farm)
en.wikipedia.org
. However, once on the road, Furiosa veers off-course without warning, steering the War Rig onto an unexplained path across the wasteland
en.wikipedia.org
. Back at the Citadel, Joe realizes something is very wrong: his five wives (young women kept as breeding slaves) are missing from their vault
en.wikipedia.org
. Rushing into the wives’ chamber, Joe finds it abandoned with the vault’s walls defaced by rebellious messages – “We are not things” and “Our babies will not be warlords” scrawled in paint
medium.com
medium.com
. Furiosa has in fact smuggled Joe’s prized wives (Splendid Angharad, Capable, Toast, the Dag, and Cheedo) inside the War Rig, intent on liberating them. Enraged by this betrayal, Immortan Joe sounds the alarm and mobilizes his entire War Boy army to pursue Furiosa
en.wikipedia.org
. He even calls on allies – the gas baron “People Eater” and the Bullet Farmer – to join the chase across the desert, while his hulking son Rictus leads the charge at his side
en.wikipedia.org
.

At the Citadel’s vehicle bays, Nux is desperate to impress Joe and join the pursuit, but he’s still weak and in need of Max’s blood. Defying orders to stay behind, Nux straps Max to the front of his car, tethered and transfusing, so he can drive into battle with his “blood bag” feeding him strength
en.wikipedia.org
. The result is a nightmarish convoy as Immortan Joe’s war-party roars out after Furiosa, engines revving and war drums pounding. Furiosa’s War Rig, with a handful of War Boy escorts aboard, soon faces its first trial: marauding scavengers known as the Buzzards ambush the convoy with spiked, weaponized vehicles
en.wikipedia.org
. A ferocious skirmish erupts amid the desert dunes – rusty cars collide and flip, War Boys leap from vehicle to vehicle in mid-speed combat, and improvised explosive spears (and mounted machine guns) turn the sand into a war zone

. Furiosa fights to keep the War Rig ahead: she rams enemy cars and skillfully picks off assailants, successfully fending off the raiders with the help of her loyal but unaware War Boy crew
en.wikipedia.org
. However, this battle is only the beginning. Joe’s main army, far larger, is closing in fast now that her deviation is known. To shake them, Furiosa steers the War Rig toward an oncoming massive sandstorm – a swirling orange cyclone of dust and lightning on the horizon
en.wikipedia.org
.

With Immortan Joe’s fleet in hot pursuit, dozens of vehicles – including Nux’s car with Max still chained to it – charge straight into the apocalyptic sandstorm. In the chaos of whipping sand and electrostatic lightning, visibility drops to zero and vehicles are pulverized by flying debris. Most of Joe’s War Boys fall back as the storm consumes the chase, but Nux, utterly fanatic, continues the pursuit inside the maelstrom

en.wikipedia.org
. The War Rig swerves and Furiosa blasts Nux’s vehicle, causing it to crash and flip end-over-end in the tempest before it can explode
en.wikipedia.org
. The wrecked car – with Nux and Max still attached – is left behind as Furiosa pushes onward and disappears into the depths of the raging sandstorm. The violent chase sequence reaches its crescendo as Nux’s overturned car is battered by the storm, ultimately halting Immortan Joe’s advance, at least for the moment
en.wikipedia.org
. (This 30-minute opener concludes with Max surviving the ordeal; when the storm settles, he will awaken amid the wreckage – but that leads into the next part of the story.)

Short Format (Scene from ~19:00–22:45)

On the open desert flats, Imperator Furiosa’s War Rig barrels forward at high speed, pursued by a swarm of war vehicles from the Citadel. A cadre of pale War Boys – Joe’s fanatical soldiers – clings to buzzing cars and motorcycles, determined to stop or overtake the rig. The camera follows an intense chase sequence: engines roar and sand plumes in their wake as Furiosa tries to outrun her pursuers

en.wikipedia.org
. Amid the frenzy, one zealous War Boy makes a dramatic suicide play – he leaps from his vehicle with a lit explosive, sacrificing himself to blow up an enemy car in a fiery blast that others cheer (a glimpse of the War Boys’ cult-like desire for “glory” in death). As the running battle hurtles into a gigantic sandstorm on the horizon, Furiosa doesn’t slow down. She drives the War Rig straight into the churning wall of dust, hoping to use the storm to lose her attackers
en.wikipedia.org
. The chase continues inside the storm, where deafening winds and lightning rip apart vehicles. Most of the pursuers fall back, but one crazed War Boy – Nux, with Max strapped to his car as a hood ornament – refuses to relent
en.wikipedia.org
. In the storm’s eerie glow, Nux tries to ram the War Rig and detonate his car as a bomb to destroy Furiosa. At the critical moment, Max (still chained to Nux’s vehicle as a human “blood bag”) manages to intervene – he breaks loose and struggles with Nux, foiling the suicide attack
en.wikipedia.org
. Furiosa seizes the chance to evade: the War Rig swerves away as Nux’s car loses control. In a final dramatic shot, Nux’s entire vehicle tumbles end-over-end amid the gale and is consumed by the storm, erupting in flames off-screen. Furiosa’s rig disappears into the dust, leaving the remaining pursuers scattered – the brutal, dust-choked chase has bought her a temporary escape from Immortan Joe’s forces

## The Town (Armored Car Heist Sequence)
Long Format (Robbery & Chase Sequence, ~38:00–66:00)

Midway through The Town, a crew of professional bank robbers executes a heist on an armored cash truck in Boston’s North End neighborhood
en.wikipedia.org
. The team – Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) and his associates Jem (Jeremy Renner), Gloansy, and Dez – don gruesome rubber nun masks and full habits as disguises, an image equal parts absurd and terrifying
en.wikipedia.org
. The scene begins with their carefully planned ambush: the armored truck makes a routine stop outside a bank, and the robbers strike with precision. They ram the truck and hold the guards at gunpoint, shouting threats through their creepy nun masks. One guard resists a moment too long and is shot, injuring him and escalating the situation in seconds
en.wikipedia.org
. Wielding assault rifles and brute force, the robbers quickly subdue the remaining guard, then stuff duffel bags with cash from the armored car. They pile into a gray minivan (their getaway vehicle) and screech away from the curb in a hail of machine-gun fire – one of the crew sprays gunshots to keep any responding officers at a distance
en.wikipedia.org
. Within moments, a Boston police cruiser gives chase, and the escape turns into a high-stakes pursuit through the North End’s narrow, winding streets
slashfilm.com
.

The ensuing car chase is fast, loud, and chaotic. The robbers’ van careens through tight residential blocks and tight alleyways, weaving around traffic and taking sharp corners at dangerous speeds as sirens wail behind them
slashfilm.com
. The gang, armed with automatic weapons, even trades gunfire with the pursuing patrol car – bullets riddle windshields and brick walls in a fierce bid to slow the police down
en.wikipedia.org
. Despite the chaos, it’s clear the thieves have a getaway plan: they know the backstreets well and manage to stay just ahead of the law. In a tense and darkly comic beat, they barrel around a corner only to encounter a lone Boston cop standing guard on the sidewalk. The robbers (still in blood-spattered nun costumes) and the officer momentarily lock eyes as the van slows. It’s a surreal tableau – four nuns with rifles staring down a stunned cop. After a heartbeat of hesitation, the officer, realizing he’s outgunned and not eager to die in a one-man shootout, pointedly looks the other way and lets them pass
slashfilm.com
. Doug and his crew speed off, taking full advantage of the brief reprieve.

The robbers then execute a clever evasion maneuver. They race into a predetermined hideaway under a bridge and stop in a secluded spot out of the police cruiser’s sight. In a well-rehearsed scramble, they bail out of the minivan and into a second getaway vehicle (often described as a black SUV or another car) that they had stashed there
slashfilm.com
. Working quickly, one member douses the inside of the abandoned minivan with gasoline. As the pursuing police close in, the crew sets the van ablaze – one robber flicks a lighter and tosses it in, igniting a fireball that engulfs the vehicle in flames
slashfilm.com
. By the time officers arrive, the van is burning furiously, creating chaos and smoke. Amid the confusion, Doug and his team slip away in their secondary car, blending into traffic before law enforcement realizes what’s happened. The flaming van not only destroys any forensic evidence (like DNA or fingerprints) but also serves as a brilliant distraction, buying the crew critical minutes to escape. In the aftermath of this daring heist, FBI Special Agent Frawley (Jon Hamm) and Boston PD investigators are left piecing together clues. The next day, Frawley hauls in Doug, Jem, and their friends for intense questioning, suspecting them of the armored car job – but with no concrete evidence or confessions, he’s forced to release them
en.wikipedia.org
. The North End robbery sequence ends with the crew having narrowly escaped the police dragnet, thanks to disguises, meticulous planning, and a willingness to employ ruthless tactics (like literally blowing up their getaway van) to ensure their freedom
en.wikipedia.org
.

Short Format (Scene from ~52:00–56:22)

A high-adrenaline heist scene unfolds as a quartet of thieves in black nun masks and habits ambush an armored truck in Boston’s North End
en.wikipedia.org
. In a blur of action, the robbers spring from their vehicle with guns drawn and demand the armored car guards surrender. The startled guards freeze – one is pistol-whipped or shoved to the ground, and another is shot and wounded when he resists, raising the stakes instantly
en.wikipedia.org
. The robbers swiftly seize bags of cash from the truck, then jump back into their gray minivan getaway car. They peel out onto the street, and a patrol car immediately gives chase, lights and siren blaring behind them
en.wikipedia.org
. What follows is a breathless car chase through the North End’s cramped streets: the van swerves around parked cars and barrels down narrow lanes, trying to shake the police. One thief leans out the window with an assault rifle, spraying bullets to deter the pursuing cruiser. Despite the chaos, the robbers stick to a plan. They veer into a side alley under a bridge where a second car is hidden. In one fluid sequence, the crew ditches the van and scrambles into the backup vehicle waiting for them
slashfilm.com
. Dressed as sinister nuns, they momentarily catch the eye of a dumbfounded lone police officer on the street – a darkly humorous standoff where the cop, seeing their automatic weapons, decides to stand down and let them pass rather than engage in a suicide mission
slashfilm.com
. The robbers then torch their original van to erase evidence: as they drive off in the new car, the abandoned van erupts in flames from a thrown lighter and gasoline, sending up billowing smoke
slashfilm.com
. The switch-and-burn tactic works perfectly. By the time police converge on the flaming vehicle, the thieves have vanished into the city, leaving behind nothing but a scorched shell and a city full of unanswered questions
en.wikipedia.org
. The key beats of this sequence – the eerie nun disguises, the explosive robbery and chase, the split-second vehicle swap, and the fiery decoy – highlight the crew’s mix of boldness and cunning that allows them to narrowly outrun law enforcement once again.

29. Despite surviving the ambush, Furiosa sees that Immortan Joe’s much larger main army is closing in now that her deviation from the assigned route has been discovered.

30. To escape the incoming convoy, Furiosa turns the War Rig toward a colossal sandstorm on the horizon, a towering orange cyclone filled with dust and lightning.

31. Immortan Joe’s fleet, including Nux’s car with Max still chained to its front, continues the chase and drives directly into the raging sandstorm after the War Rig.

32. Inside the storm, visibility becomes almost zero as vehicles are buffeted by hurricane-force winds, flying debris, and electrostatic lightning strikes.

33. Many of Joe’s pursuing vehicles and War Boys fall back or are destroyed as the storm tears through the convoy.

34. Nux, driven by fanaticism and a desire for a glorious death, refuses to fall back and continues the pursuit of the War Rig within the heart of the sandstorm.

35. Nux prepares to sacrifice himself in a suicide attack by lighting a flare and planning to crash his car into Furiosa’s War Rig, detonating explosives to destroy it.

36. Max, still strapped to the front of Nux’s car, is forced into this suicide mission, facing certain death if the collision occurs.

37. At the critical moment, Max struggles violently against his restraints, manages to break free, and directly grapples with Nux inside the car.

38. Max’s interference prevents Nux from completing his kamikaze attack and stops the planned detonation.

39. Amid the chaos, Furiosa maneuvers the War Rig to avoid destruction, and she fires on Nux’s vehicle, blasting it and causing it to roll and flip end-over-end inside the storm.

40. Nux’s car crashes and overturns violently in the sandstorm, leaving Nux and Max still entangled with the wreck.

41. Furiosa continues driving the War Rig deeper into the sandstorm, using the storm’s cover to evade the bulk of Immortan Joe’s forces.

42. As the chase peaks in intensity, the overturned wreck containing Nux and Max is pounded by the storm’s winds and debris until it finally comes to a halt.

43. The destruction and chaos of the sandstorm bring Immortan Joe’s immediate advance to a temporary stop, giving Furiosa and the wives a brief advantage in their escape.
