12. As everyone turns to watch him, Gregory panics and finally admits that he does not like pizza at all.

13. Gregory explains that he invented the story about Baltimore-style pizza because he wanted to fit in with his colleagues.

14. The group reacts with shock and disbelief, with Melissa, Barbara, and Jacob exclaiming and questioning how anyone could dislike pizza.

15. Gregory confesses that he is an extremely picky eater who only enjoys a small number of foods and that he usually hides this because people overreact when they find out.

## Mad Max - Long Form

1. In a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland, petrol (gasoline) and water are extremely scarce and precious resources.

2. Max Rockatansky, a lone drifter, wanders this wasteland as a hardened survivor.

3. Max is suddenly ambushed and captured by the War Boys, a group of feral, fanatical soldiers devoted to the warlord Immortan Joe.

4. The War Boys drag Max to Immortan Joe’s desert stronghold, a fortress known as the Citadel.

5. At the Citadel, Max is identified as a universal blood donor and is imprisoned.

6. Max is strapped into medical apparatus and used as a living “blood bag,” providing continuous blood transfusions to a sickly War Boy named Nux.

7. Max makes an early, frantic attempt to escape from the Citadel by fleeing through its twisting underground tunnels and caves.

8. The War Boys quickly recapture Max and chain him up again, reinforcing his status as Nux’s captive blood donor.

9. Meanwhile, Immortan Joe rules the Citadel by hoarding water, controlling the supply, and maintaining power through fear and oppression.

10. Immortan Joe orders his elite driver and warrior, Imperator Furiosa, to take a massive armored tanker truck called the War Rig on a mission.

11. Furiosa departs from the Citadel in the War Rig, accompanied by a small escort of War Boys, supposedly to barter for fuel and ammunition at two allied outposts: Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.

12. Once on the open road, Furiosa suddenly deviates from the planned route and steers the War Rig off-course into the wider wasteland, without explaining her change of direction.

13. Back at the Citadel, Immortan Joe notices that something is wrong when he goes to check on his prized “wives,” a group of five young women kept as breeding slaves.

14. Joe discovers that the vault where the wives are kept is empty, and the women are missing.

15. Inside the abandoned chamber, Joe finds rebellious messages painted on the walls, including “We are not things” and “Our babies will not be warlords.”

16. It is revealed that Furiosa has secretly smuggled the five wives—Splendid Angharad, Capable, Toast, the Dag, and Cheedo—into the War Rig in order to free them from Joe.

17. Infuriated by Furiosa’s betrayal and the loss of his wives, Immortan Joe sounds the alarm throughout the Citadel.

18. Immortan Joe assembles his War Boy army, ordering them to mount vehicles and pursue Furiosa across the desert.

19. Joe calls in reinforcements from his allies, including the grotesque gas baron known as the People Eater and the militaristic Bullet Farmer, to join the chase.

20. Immortan Joe’s hulking son, Rictus Erectus, takes a prominent role in the pursuit, riding alongside Joe in the convoy.

21. In the Citadel’s vehicle bays, Nux desperately wants to prove himself to Immortan Joe and insists on joining the pursuit, even though he is physically weak and still dependent on Max’s blood.

22. Ignoring orders to stay behind, Nux chains Max to the front of his car as a human hood ornament, keeping the blood transfusion line attached so that Max continues to feed him strength.

23. Nux drives out with Max strapped to his vehicle, joining the massive war convoy as it roars out of the Citadel in pursuit of Furiosa’s War Rig.

24. Furiosa’s War Rig, accompanied by a small group of loyal but uninformed War Boys, is soon attacked in the open desert by a gang of scavengers known as the Buzzards, who drive spiked, armored vehicles.

25. A brutal, high-speed battle breaks out as the Buzzards’ cars ram, harpoon, and surround the War Rig and its escort vehicles.

26. War Boys leap between moving vehicles, wielding weapons and explosive spears, while mounted guns and collisions turn the desert into a chaotic battlefield.

27. Furiosa fights from the cab of the War Rig, ramming enemy vehicles and coordinating her crew to repel the Buzzard ambush.

28. With skilled driving and ruthless tactics, Furiosa and her War Boys manage to destroy or drive off the Buzzard attackers, keeping the War Rig moving forward.

29. Despite surviving the ambush, Furiosa sees that Immortan Joe’s much larger main army is closing in now that her deviation from the assigned route has been discovered.

30. To escape the incoming convoy, Furiosa turns the War Rig toward a colossal sandstorm on the horizon, a towering orange cyclone filled with dust and lightning.

31. Immortan Joe’s fleet, including Nux’s car with Max still chained to its front, continues the chase and drives directly into the raging sandstorm after the War Rig.

32. Inside the storm, visibility becomes almost zero as vehicles are buffeted by hurricane-force winds, flying debris, and electrostatic lightning strikes.

33. Many of Joe’s pursuing vehicles and War Boys fall back or are destroyed as the storm tears through the convoy.

34. Nux, driven by fanaticism and a desire for a glorious death, refuses to fall back and continues the pursuit of the War Rig within the heart of the sandstorm.

35. Nux prepares to sacrifice himself in a suicide attack by lighting a flare and planning to crash his car into Furiosa’s War Rig, detonating explosives to destroy it.

36. Max, still strapped to the front of Nux’s car, is forced into this suicide mission, facing certain death if the collision occurs.

37. At the critical moment, Max struggles violently against his restraints, manages to break free, and directly grapples with Nux inside the car.

38. Max’s interference prevents Nux from completing his kamikaze attack and stops the planned detonation.

39. Amid the chaos, Furiosa maneuvers the War Rig to avoid destruction, and she fires on Nux’s vehicle, blasting it and causing it to roll and flip end-over-end inside the storm.

40. Nux’s car crashes and overturns violently in the sandstorm, leaving Nux and Max still entangled with the wreck.

41. Furiosa continues driving the War Rig deeper into the sandstorm, using the storm’s cover to evade the bulk of Immortan Joe’s forces.

42. As the chase peaks in intensity, the overturned wreck containing Nux and Max is pounded by the storm’s winds and debris until it finally comes to a halt.

43. The destruction and chaos of the sandstorm bring Immortan Joe’s immediate advance to a temporary stop, giving Furiosa and the wives a brief advantage in their escape.
