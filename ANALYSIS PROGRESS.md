# Analysis Progress Log

- 2025-11-04: Initialized analysis log. Loaded `results/uv_merged.csv` within `analysis/analysis_self-report.ipynb` and produced a column-to-category overview at `results/uv_column_categories.csv` for upcoming hypothesis workflows.
- 2025-11-04: Reformatted `results/uv_column_categories.csv` to contain explicit `header` and `category` columns for easier filtering in later stages.
- 2025-11-04: Began H1 analysis; created tidy enjoyment dataset, generated within-subject paired t-tests with visualisations, and ran title-level mixed models for `EnjoymentComposite_Normalised` variants.
- 2025-11-04: Extended H1 Part 2 checks to include `EnjoymentComposite_Sum` and `EnjoymentComposite_Corrected`, confirming mixed-model directionality across raw composites.
- 2025-11-04: Added `EnjoymentComposite_Mean` to both within-subject and mixed-model runs to compare scaling differences across composites.
- 2025-11-04: Refined Part 1 visuals to focus on normalized composites (`EnjoymentComposite_Normalized` and `_NormalizedCorrected`) so plots align with per-item scaling, removing `_Sum` and `_Corrected` variants.
- 2025-11-04: Introduced normalized subscale analyses plus title-level mixed models, and added a subscale item-count inventory to explain discrepancies between normalized and summed composites.
