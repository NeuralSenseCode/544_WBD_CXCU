# Stage 3 Integration
#file:METHOD.md #file:PROGRESS.md

Begin with Stage 3: post-viewing recall/recognition. Create or update the corresponding subsection so the UV captures responses from the questionnaire administered seven days after the study.

Follow the guidelines outlined in `METHOD.md`, referencing `PROGRESS.md` for the historical context of the Stage 1–3 pipeline restructuring.
When modifying existing cells, rerun them (and any downstream dependencies) automatically, then verify the refreshed output files are free of the errors we intended to address.
