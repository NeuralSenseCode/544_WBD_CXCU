# New Stage
#file:METHOD.md #file:PROGRESS.md

Lets begin with Stage 4: Recall. Create a new subsection for this stage, where we will no focus on adding into the UV responses from a Recall questionnare administered 7 days after the study.

For our work in this section, we will abide by the guidelines and practices outlined in METHOD.md.
I will also need you to run cells automatically, and check for errrors in the output files to verify results. If changes are made to existing cell, I will need you to automatically rerun cells and then verify that the output files are free of the errors we attempted to correct.
