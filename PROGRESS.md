# Project Progress Log

_Last updated: 2025-10-27_

This log captures the current state of analysis so future sessions can resume seamlessly. The immediate focus is reviewing full-cohort Stage 2 results and addressing the logged issues.

---

## Repository Setup
- Added `METHOD.md` documenting the unified view (UV) methodology, including naming conventions (`{form}_{title}_{sensor_type}_{metric}_{method}`), baseline respondent columns, and integration workflow guidance.
- Updated `.gitignore` so that only `data/Export/` is excluded while other files in `data/` remain trackable. This keeps raw sensor exports out of Git but allows reference tables (e.g., `stimulus_rename`, `key_moments`) to be versioned.
- Committed and pushed all current changes to `master` (commit `da6126e`).

## Data Assets Added
- `data/stimulus_rename.csv` contains group-specific stimulus names mapped to canonical titles and presentation forms (`Long` vs `Short`).
- `data/key_moments.csv` lists long-form stimuli with lead-up duration and key-moment duration to align short-form clips with the relevant segment of the long cut.

## Notebook: `analysis/assemble_uv.ipynb`
The notebook is organized into sections with the active work under **Feature Extraction**.

### Stimulus Duration Scan
- Located one sensor CSV per group (Groups Aâ€“F) via filesystem crawl.
- Used `read_imotions` to ingest each sample file.
- Calculated stimulus durations per file using the `Timestamp` column without cross-group aggregation.
- Produced `stimulus_summary` (36 rows) with columns:
  - `group`
  - `stimulus_name`
  - `duration_seconds`
  - `duration_minutes`
- Verified each group contains six unique stimuli and exported the table to `results/stimulus_summary.csv`.

### Annotation Context
- Documented how `stimulus_rename` and `key_moments` support mapping raw stimuli to titles/forms and identifying key-moment windows for long-form content.

### Stage 1: Demographics
- Scanned **every** sensor export under `data/Export/Group */Analyses/*/Sensor Data/`.
- Extracted metadata via `read_imotions` using keys:
  - `Study name`
  - `Respondent Name`
  - `Respondent Age`
  - `Respondent Gender`
  - `Respondent Group`
  - `Recording time`
- Implemented robust parsing to clean metadata quirks:
  - Removed trailing comma padding.
  - Derived `group` from study name (final letter) or fallback path.
  - Captured numeric respondent IDs (handles up to 3 digits).
  - Converted age to integer, gender to title-case categories (`Male`, `Female`, `Other`).
  - Split recording timestamp into `date_study` and `time_study`, converting to America/Chicago timezone.
- Constructed `uv_stage1` (and mirrored `uv`) with columns:
  - `source_file`
  - `group`
  - `respondent`
  - `age`
  - `gender`
  - `date_study`
  - `time_study`
- Verified there are no duplicate respondents.
- Applied manual gender overrides for respondents `8`, `56`, `16`, `6`, `46`, `69`, `44`, and `50` per client guidance.
- Enriched `uv_stage1` by joining the refreshed `data/grid.csv`, mapping the survey fields into `age_group`, `ethnicity`, `income_group`, `content_consumption`, and the `%` split columns (`content_consumption_movies`, `content_consumption_series`, `content_consumption_short`) with careful ID coercion and whitespace cleanup to prevent nulls.
- Exported the demographic UV snapshot to `results/uv_stage1_demographics.csv` (now including the supplemental survey fields).

### Stage 2: Sensor Data (Full Sample)
- Finalized helper stack: `read_imotions`, `prepare_stimulus_segment`, `compute_sensor_features`, and the new orchestration wrapper `run_sensor_feature_pipeline`.
- The pipeline now validates sensor coverage per respondent, auto-detects EEG alias columns, handles long-form key-moment windowing, and computes FAC/EEG/GSR/ET metrics with unified naming.
- Executed `run_sensor_feature_pipeline()` across all respondents (83 total); results exported to:
  - `results/uv_stage2_full_features.csv`
  - `results/uv_stage2_full_uv.csv`
  - `results/uv_stage2_full_issues.csv` (38 rows documenting missing sensors, unmapped stimuli, or empty windows).
- Implemented safe CSV writing with timestamped fallbacks to avoid permission clashes and added `gc.collect()` guards to keep memory pressure manageable during batch processing.

### Notebook Outputs
- `full_features` dataframe currently holds 1,076 Stage 2 feature columns aligned to 83 respondents.
- `full_issues` records outstanding data gaps per respondent/stimulus to triage before downstream modeling.
- `full_uv` merges Stage 1 demographics with Stage 2 features, providing the latest unified view snapshot.

### Variables in Notebook Session
- `uv_stage1` and `uv` hold the demographic dataset; manual overrides are applied in place.
- `stimulus_summary` remains available for join operations if further timing diagnostics are needed.
- `full_features`, `full_uv`, and `full_issues` persist in memory for quick inspection during issue resolution.

## Next Steps
1. Review `results/uv_stage2_full_issues.csv` to reconcile missing sensor streams or unmapped stimuli (38 entries).
2. Confirm downstream consumers ingest the new `uv_stage2_full_uv.csv` and coordinate with analytics leads on required feature subsets.
3. Plan integration of survey/self-report datasets (e.g., `data/Export/.../Survey/`) alongside the Stage 2 metrics for the full UV.
