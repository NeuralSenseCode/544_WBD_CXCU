# Initialisation
- use a PROGRESS.md document
- create a library for this project that includes a whole load of helpers, and every helper function generated in this project must be made in the library

# Stage 3 Integration
#file:METHOD.md #file:PROGRESS.md

Begin with Stage 3: post-viewing recall/recognition. Create or update the corresponding subsection so the UV captures responses from the questionnaire administered seven days after the study.

Follow the guidelines outlined in `METHOD.md`, referencing `PROGRESS.md` for the historical context of the Stage 1–3 pipeline restructuring.
When modifying existing cells, rerun them (and any downstream dependencies) automatically, then verify the refreshed output files are free of the errors we intended to address.

You can use pylanceRunCodeSnippet / pylance MCP server


# New Task

For this task, documentation will be kept in `tasks\13-11-25 Biometric KM analysis` folder. 

FOr now, do not do anything in code, Simply draw up a detailed, numbered task plan, and include it along with a task description as a TASK_PLAN.md in the task folder. Do not create any documents or write any code. 

All helper functions for this project are found in wbdlib. Throughout this task, try to leverage existing helpers from the library as far as possible. Instead of creating new helpers in the notebook, try to call existing helpers in the library. If a new helper is required, add it to the library along with the doc-string, and then call it in the botebook. If a modification to an exisitng helper is required, ensuring that all call to it remain unaffected, or are updated accordingly.

Try not to use the command line, terminal or powershell for this task, unless it is the only option.

Amazing. We will now work through the task. Add a new section to the task plan called 'Progress'. As we complete each step, please add a log-type entry in this section.
