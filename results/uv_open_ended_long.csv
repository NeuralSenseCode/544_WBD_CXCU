The white male actor drove to the city where the pizza is and brought it to the other actor to eat because he said it was his favorite kind of pizza. Gregory does not like pizza and is very specific about the foods he eats. His co worker brought the pizza as a friend to him at work so he could enjoy the pizza while the other co workers ate different varieties of pizza
107,F,Post,Q13,Recall,Long,Abbot Elementary,The guy grabbing the pizza in reality doesn’t like pizza but he is ashamed to admit at first because he doesn’t want to be judged.

41,F,Post,Q13,Recall,Long,Abbot Elementary,"So when he said that he liked the pizza from Boston crispy and soggy, he didn't realize that his coworker would go out and buy it and bring it over to him so even though his coworker surprised him with the pizza that he claimed he liked, he still wasn't interested in the pizza. He just said it just to make his coworkers happy"
42,F,Post,Q13,Recall,Long,Abbot Elementary,"In this scene, the guy looking at the pizza with disdain lied to his friends about liking pizza by making up this huge story about how he only likes pizza from Boston I believe, and he said it was like wet and also crunchy so his friend drove all the way over there and got him a pizza and this is basically the scene where they find out that he lied to them and he just doesn’t like pizza or lots of other foods that are American staples. The characters were these two guys that are in the picture as well as four other women who are also part of the cast, though I believe only two of those other women were part of this particular scene."

16,C,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Abbot Elementary,"There were two main plots, one plot was that the light skin male did not like pizza and his colleagues were surprised by it. He said he only liked pizza from Delaware extra wet and so one of his friends got him that pizza so they could eat pizza together and see which pizza was the best. The other plot involved one of the teachers leading students in a step class after school and another teacher or principal wanting to take over that class and initially just having fun with the students and not working on step. The first teacher gets upset and the Second Lady gets more involved and the episode ends with a step show during a school event and the second teacher leaves right before the show leaving the students without the ability to show their dance to the school. The first teacher convinces her to show the school stepping together and both and the students step dance for the school and everyone is impressed and their relationship is good after"

One of the teachers told them he only liked Baltimore pizza from a made up name in the previous scene, and in this scene the other male teacher drove there and brought it back so he could eat it ""wet"". But really the teacher was lying and hates pizza. And didn't want to tell the other teachers because they would make fun of him. This is the moment he picks up the pizza and then tells them he lied and hates pizza. They are shocked and think he is weird for not liking pizza. He says this is why he didn't tell them in the first place."
63,C,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Abbot Elementary,"The person on the right does not like pizza and tries to avoid a pizza lunch with his co-workers in the teachers lounge. He is then given a slice of pizza by the person on the left and it is gross and wet looking. The guy on the right is disgusted by it and does not even want to pick it up, but he is forced to try it and backs out at the last second and comes clean about his aversion to pizza."
82,C,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Abbot Elementary,"The Black character doesn't eat a lot of popular foods, and pizza is one of those foods. In this scene, his co-workers are trying to get him to try a slice of pizza. He was truly disgusted by the pizza. To avoid situations like this, he would eat in his car so that he wouldn't be judged by his co-workers."
88,C,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Abbot Elementary,"Previously the character named Gregory said that his favorite type of pizza was Baltimore style, which apparently is ""wet,"" from a pizzeria he named. A colleague named Jacob traveled to Baltimore to purchase a ""wet"" pizza from the named pizzeria so that Gregory could enjoy it. However, Gregory actually does not enjoy pizza and the picture above is a shot of him taking a piece of the ""wet"" pizza with great trepidation/"
89,C,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Abbot Elementary,Not sure about the scene.  It may have been when the man on the right was pretending that he liked pizza. He said that he liked wet pizza from a specific place in Baltimore or Maryland I think. And then the guy on the left actually drove two hours to pick up his favorite pizza. It ends up the guy in the right really doesn’t like pizza.

10,B,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,Watching the movie it sort of followed the plot line. It was a little hard to follow at times
15,B,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,From the start of the scene the story line was pretty clear and easy to follow.
37,B,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,What helped my understanding was the camera work. The way the shots focused on the action happening helped me infer what could be going on
39,B,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,The imagery. There was not a lot of dialogue. The way her Father reacted once he discovered Furiosa's intention was telling.
56,B,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,The scene was action packed many explosions people died. The coinciding parts made me want to find out more
58,B,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,i've seen other mad max films before so i knew the gist of things of whats happenign in this world
64,B,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,Having context for the characters and scene from watching the entire intro and everything helped. It was also shot and edited in such a way that the action was clear and easy to follow.
73,B,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,"The theme of the place, the action, the vehicles, & overall feeling ."
77,B,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,The dialogue between characters helped me understand some of the action occurring.
90,B,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,"The additional scenes showing the reign and control of the warlord, as well as the actual heir trying to exit from a hidden compartment in the rig."
100,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,Nothing really. It was a best guess of my understanding of what happened based on context clues
108,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,What helped me understand the scene more was hearing the brothers talk about the situation.
20,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,The scene of the movie attracted my attention and wanted to watch the whole movie at home
36,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,Paying attention for sure . Being able to focused on the movie and its entirety.
40,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,While there was a lot going on it was easy to figure out that Furiosa was basically stealing the rig and these people was chasing her. Trying to get her to stop.
49,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,I has seen this movie and the rest of the MAD MAX franchise before. MAX is always central to every movie with the one armed Fusioso devops her character with very little dialogue
69,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,What helped my understanding is that I know the tied up man was an enemy.
74,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,not really that much.  It is pretty self explanatory.  but more explanation of the back story would make it better
79,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,While watching everything was clear to understand who was who and against who
80,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,I think the clip being extremely action packed and it’s ability to hold my attention was very helpful to my underhanding.
84,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,The side shot was clear to depict that she was in danger and able to escape as she acted quickly to just barely escape.
86,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,Nothing really I have a poor memory of this one as I couldn’t focus on what was going on
9,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,The graphics helped my understanding. But the scene just kept going on
97,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,Mad Max,"They had good exposition and clues into how the particular world worked. Especially calling them ""blood banks"" and ""breeders"" respectively."
37,B,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Long,Mad Max,"My understanding could’ve been improved more, the film was confusing without speaking. The characters didn’t speak at all."
56,B,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Long,Mad Max,More context  of the scene and who these things are and what they want to accomplish
58,B,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Long,Mad Max,more details on the characters from mad max and more details on the world they live in
73,B,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Long,Mad Max,Probably if the dialogue was louder & everything didn't feel repetitive
77,B,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Long,Mad Max,"The scene simply needed to be based more on realism and needed not be consistently action-packed, allowing the scene more time to develop."
100,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Long,Mad Max,I don’t think anything. Maybe having seen the movie before as I have not
36,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Long,Mad Max,If I had seen the entire movie . I only saw a fourth of the movie . I think if I saw more I could have a stronger opinion!
69,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Long,Mad Max,What would have improved my understanding is if I had read the plot of the movie.
79,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Long,Mad Max,I have seen the movie before but do not have great background on the mad max universe and what everyone’s roles are. I am not sure of the names of the groups or detailed information about them which leaves me a little bit confused during some scenes
80,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Long,Mad Max,I think being introduced to the characters properly by knowing their name and backstory I would know more about them and would be able to solidify a relationship with the character. In turn I would remember more or understand more of the video clip.
84,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Long,Mad Max,If thier was a close uo and then a long shot from behind to clear the understanding that she got away and diverted danger.
86,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Long,Mad Max,Not much I didn’t find this seem very amusing and found it easy to lose track of what was going on
9,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Long,Mad Max,I didn't completely understand the plot. The scene was very disturbing and not my favorite
97,E,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Long,Mad Max,It being anything remotely based in reality. I don't watch many movies like this so it took a while to understand the world.
10,B,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,This chase scene was about a battle to catch Imperator Furiosa and then there was another gang that intercepted them and the fight began. Rocky was hood ornament.

Another gang tried to stop them and this big battle broke out with Rocky as a hood ornament.  Furiosa managed to get away in a big sand storm.
37,B,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,This one was difficult because of how long the scene was. But I remember the guy jumped with two sticks and exploded the car infront of him. After he jumped the guy dies and the car explodes and causes damage all around him. This was a scene I had to recall because I remember it was one of the shocking moments
39,B,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,Furiosa chose to take her Father's oil rig off the designated route. This caused a stir and a chase ensued. Tom Hardy's character is strapped to the front of the chasing car. This allows the driver to survive as he needs it survive and drive. The driver follows Furiosa into a big storm and attempts to blow himself up to stop her. This fails as the flare doesn't ignite an explosion.
56,B,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,They took away some people who I think were the breeders or the woman and they were getting chased. They decided to run into enemy territory and into the storm in order to lose them. The person who was getting their blood taken out was tied to the car. They end up killing the enemy’s but many of the friendlies end up dying.

I believed they ended up getting away but im not too sure about that there was alot of screaming & brutality There was also some guy playing guitar"
77,B,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,"My summarization of this scene will be much more general as there was confusion and lack of clarity on my part. An escape occurred and then there was an intense chase scene that required three different entities, all of whom had many different weapons and other tools to their disposal. The chase took place in a dessert and featured many different power struggles occurring amongst the different entities."
90,B,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,The Half Life War Boys and their warlord leader are chasing down a rogue imperator  named Furiousa that seems to be transporting the young adult female heir (and potentially others) of the warlord and his hostage mate.

100,E,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,Furiosa took off with females being used for their breeding. This ensues a chase between Furiosa and the other members of the group. It’s a super intense chase and fight scene. Mad max is chained to the front of the car and is being used for his blood by the driver who is sick. Everyone’s trying to kill everyone
108,E,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,"In this scene, the main character was tied to a car to be someone's blood bank because it looked like they were dying, but they wanted to die trying to protect their group.

36,E,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,They had captured the man and was riding across the desert to fight the enemies . I felt like they were also fighting each other for power and control. It was a lot of action for sure . I felt like those characters all had been adubted at some point and were turned into something they were not in the beginning.
40,E,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,the 'bad people' are chasing Furiosa who has veered off course from the original destination to get fuel. These people are all chasing her. The guy who is in mid air jumped off Furiosa's tanker truck and was trying to prevent the chasers from stopping her. The guy strapped to the car on the left is Max who was kidnapped. They are using his blood to power their car.
49,E,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,"Being familiar with the franchise it depicts a post apocalyptic world where water and gasoline are the most precious commodities. This was different as it introduced virginal woman as commodities too. The WAR BOYS were a great addition too, as one seems to defect and join Max and Furiousa. Charlize Theron and Tom Harden played the reluctant hero's."
69,E,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,"The warriors were driving strange looking vehicles. The  warriors had captured  I believe Max they tied him up they were traveling to go to war with other warriors. There was great violent scenes to my, the violent scenes were happening really fast for me I tried to keep up with the scenes from the  movie"
74,E,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,They are chasing a gas truck because there is a shortage of gas and gas is a commodity which is very valuable.  They are attacking and killing each other in a road race across a desert.  It is cool to watch but kind of gets very repetitive after awhile.  Also they dont explain why all the characters look like monsters kind of
79,E,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,"In this scene, the man jumping surrendered himself to take down one of the spikey cars that is their enemy. He is jumping off of his vehicle to land on the spikey vehicle and makes it explode.

A women who was leading a team was on a mission but decided at that’s moment to stray from the mission and to accomplish her own plan. Thus a crew was sent out to stop the women from straying too far from the mission was there to ultimately punish her.
84,E,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,The man in back tosses the spear. The man pouncing upon the car gets speared. The car in front crashed into a flaming crash and all involved are burned in a great ball of fire. Then Furiosa and passenger are able to drive ahead and escape. The care continues to drive ahead and surpass all that are chasing it.
86,E,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,"They were trying to run away and these vehicles. They had a guy strapped to the front and he was injured.

9,E,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,"They were chasing each other. They were chasing the female character because she was running away with some people hidden in her car. There was a character with guitar at the front of the car. In another car, there was a guy hooked up to get a blood transfusion from one of the demons. This scene was long and drawn out!"
97,E,Post,Q18,Recall,Long,Mad Max,"This was a long long long chase scene where one group was running from their horrible kingdom. The women breeders were escaping with Charlize's help. Meanwhile the soliders from the kingdom were chasing them. The man on the front of the car is a peasant being used as a ""blood bank"" for the soldiers who seem to keep other people's blood to survive. Maybe that is why they are so pale."

55,A,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,The masked heist member really helped me understand the scene. It took me back to the part when they were waiting on the armory truck to arrive with the money so that they could make a clean getaway without being caught. It was a lot of commotion because one of the armored officers ended up getting shot by the masked gunman.
8,A,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,"It was a longer scene, which made it easier to understand the plot. The masks were extremely memorable, which helped to keep the details of the scene in my mind."
81,A,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,Watching it?? There is not anything specific from the scene that helped me understand it
83,A,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,"I had seen the movie a few times previously, and the torching of the vehicle is still vivid in my recollection"

102,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,Just paying attention to the scene and being able to be a fan of the movie.
111,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,"The length of the video helped me understand what had happened. Also, in a later scene, Jon Hamm's character is seen investigating the burnt vehicle and refers to a single fingerprint being found in the torched wreckage."
115,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,The plot was pretty straight forward regarding the robbery and the actions they were taking made sense practically speaking
19,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,"The scene itself was relatively straightforward. Some components (like how they were connected to the woman) were unclear, but I could follow the robbery and chase well without background context."
2,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,Paying attention. Also not being an entire episode.
35,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,The thing that helped me understand was just the action in the movie that made it very good and very easy to remember. Just a great scene.
4,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,A more connected storyline would have helped but I tried to pay attention to the characters and where they are next and then drew some conclusions
46,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,There was good context before and after. I was interested in the story so I was zoned in as well
51,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,"I'm no sure what you mean by what helped my understanding...

68,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,"The movie scene feels very similar to other scenes. The overall plot of this segment of the story is quite common, and if anything, there are slight variations from a basic robbery. My attention was also grabbed because of the robbers wearing those masks."
72,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,"I was torn between two scenes. The one that I described where the bank heist went wrong and the last scene I saw when they get cornered by the police car and it’s a standdown. The white wall in the back of the person wearing the mask, reminded me more of the color of the bank in the high scene. The scene where they got caught I felt it was more red brick buildings."
76,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,Knowing the movie before hand and remembering the nun masks and great action with the police chase
91,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,The plot the characters and the time line. The scenes with the various situations.
92,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,My recollection is really good as far as remembering images things happening in movies. What helped my understanding is key things that happened in the scene.
94,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,"What had helped my understanding was just breathing in and out. Clearing my mind, my thoughts. And remembering that picture that the video of the robber with the with the Nun suit. Just thinking back about that scene. The irony. That they thought they got away. But ran into a police officer that was parked. Watching construction being done over the street. 
He was minding his business he didn’t want trouble they didn’t want to kill him or shoot. So they both left. Split ways and learn about their way. The robbers with the money. And the police officer with his life."
117,F,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Long,The Town,"The scene had a lot of action happening, which made it easy to watch and follow along with the story."
4,D,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionImprove,Long,The Town,More context of the scene. At times it appeared out if sequence and after the robbery they initially get away but then scene switched and they are caught.  Little confusing.

100,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,I had already seen it prior to last weeks session. It rung a bell in my head
108,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,What helped me more in this scene was Greg verbally explaining his eating habits to his coworkers.
20,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,On what they were talking about and the thing was a teacher not liking pizza
36,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,Seeing the photo helped me remember. I saw this episode prior . I like watching this show !
40,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,the conversation was very clear and easy to follow along. They used words that clearly expressed what was going on. It was vague.
49,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,"As mentioned in part 1, I wasn't;t familiar with the characters or the plot of the show. Does it concentrate on the teachers, th students or both?"
69,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,I know of two of the characters by actual name. I have enjoyed movies that I have watched with them act in. So therefor I was very comfortable watching the scene.
74,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,when he explained that he only ate 5 foods.  I guess that was sort of different or peculiar but not really funny
79,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,The scene was very straightforward to understand. The pizza was a good reminder of the scene.
80,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,I think having prior knowledge of the characters and who they play in the show helped me to maintain a recollection of the scene but it still wasn’t enough to fully remember the scene.
84,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,"The way he selected the pizza, like someone picking up a baby with love and desire."
86,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,It was a memorable scene and I enjoyed the show. I even thought about watching it later on.
9,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,Seeing a visual of the scene helped me in my understanding of the scene
97,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,It was easy to gather context clues and followed the format of sitcoms.
6,C,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,The episode was funny as well as engaging to watch. Making me care for the characters and their plights within their school.
102,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,A huge fan of the show so it was easy to remember the scene especially when I saw the pizza slice.
111,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,The conversation between the characters helped me understand that Gregory has an issue with pizza and did not want to be honest that he does not like to eat any type that has multiple ingredients.
115,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,Very simplistic storyline and the characters were pretty explanatory in their presentation
19,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,The dialogue gave a pretty clear idea of what was going on. It also helped that I had seen some parts of this show before and so I had some background context
35,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,"Nothing I was unable to watch the scene due to technical difficulties in the project, trying to set up my equipment"
4,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,The story was funny and easy to follow but I just do not recall it right now
46,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,The context was helpful to understanding and I could relate to this scene because I used to not like pizza
51,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,Nothing. I didn't understand the point of the scene. It seemed like a bunch of random people arguing about what they wanted for lunch and one of them had bought food for someone which he inexplicably revealed only after the topic came up in conversation. If you bought someone their favorite pizza why would you hide that fact until the person mentioned likeing it?
66,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,"The dialog between the teachers and the visuals, put all the facts of the scene together"
67,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,"Having previously watched Abbott, I understand that the character Gregory has lots of quirks."
68,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,"The topic in the video was easy to understand. The scene was short and got straight to the point. I, myself, struggle with not liking some foods that most people enjoy, which can lead others to start being critical of that. I understand the dilemma presented in the video, as well as the fact that pizza is another item that is liked by most people."
72,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,Gregory’s facial expressions and as a pizza lover I also couldn’t relate to his distaste for pizza.
76,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,That Gregory didnt like any pizza it helped it stand out and make it memorable because I rarely extremely rarely ever hear someone dislike pizza of all kinds actually I don’t think I cann think of anyone off the top I know people that aren’t eating it for dietary restrictions
91,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,Understanding the characters and their motivation from both points of view.
92,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,Key things like the pizza given to the actor opposite of the other actor
94,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Abbot Elementary,"What had helped my understanding was just taking my time with the answer and looking back at the image analyzing the pics of the facial expression, the body language, what was said. How characters reacted."
20,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Abbot Elementary,If the clips were a bit longer so I could get a better understanding of the whole clip
49,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Abbot Elementary,"I has never watched the show, so having a basic understanding of the characters would have helped understand them"
74,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Abbot Elementary,the context.  I dont really watch that show so i didnt understand how or why that was supposed to be interesting or funny
80,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Abbot Elementary,Having more context on the scene. Watching it for a longer length. Also if the scene was a little bit more entertaining or created more of an intense emotion.
84,E,Post,Q15-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Abbot Elementary,"He would devour it quickly and completely for all to see, and would take another slice with much gusto."
35,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Abbot Elementary,if I was able to watch it that would’ve helped me a lot I was unable to watch the scene
51,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Abbot Elementary,"Watching the whole episode might have helped. The scene was out of context. I might have been useful to know more about the show and the characters too,"
76,D,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Abbot Elementary,Knowing the show more and the characters who they were what they were like and getting to be familiar with them

100,E,Post,Q13,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,"They’re trying to get Mr Eddie to eat pizza that Mr Hill brought him. Turns out Mr Eddie doesn’t like pizza and is a very picky eater, with the janitor Mr Johnson repeating that Mr Eddie doesn’t like bacon. The two female teachers (Howard & Schemmenty) give Mr Eddie a hard time for him not liking pizza and they all begin quizzing him on other foods he likes or dislikes"
108,E,Post,Q13,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,"The coworkers were trying to get him to eat pizza, even offering some from 2 different places, one he once claimed he liked but discovered that he lied about liking it and is actually a very picky eater. Then he said that's why he does not like to tell people about his eating habits because they often have harsh reactions."
20,E,Post,Q13,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,One of his colleagues got him his own pizza for their pizza day for the teachers in the teacher lounge and the pizza was soggy when he lifted it and then he told them that he doesn’t like pizza and everyone in the room was shocked and questioning him about not liking pizza. Then he told them the reason why he doesn’t like pizza
36,E,Post,Q13,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,"The crew was eatting pizza . Several of the actors were eatting pizza . The actor was asked to have  a slice of pizza , he didn’t like it ( he don’t really like pizza ) and he told the other actor. He thinks pizza isn’t a good meal plus it was rather wet . He’s likes bring his own lunch to work . He rather a different kind of human being/ nothing wrong with liking what you likes ."
40,E,Post,Q13,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,It was set in a lunchroom at an office. Some people ordered pizza - everyone thought the person on the right loved pizza when in reality he hated pizza. But just told everyone he did to basically fit in and not get questions as to why in the world wouldn't he live pizza. The other people in the lunchroom were asking questions.
49,E,Post,Q13,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,"I was vaguely familiar with this show, although I had never watched it. They were in the teachers lounge, or a storeroom. The discussion was about pizza, with one character saying he didn't eat that variety which I think was pepperoni. Also a mention of how greasy it was too. You can tell by the look on his face that he doesn't like it."
69,E,Post,Q13,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,In this scene of Abbott Elementary the subject that was being talked about was favorite foods. The Principal Gregory and another co worker were talking about food or favorite food in the school cafeteria. Gregory was asked what was his favorite food. As Gregory was picking up a slice of the pizza was asking about liking pizza and he said he did not like pizza
74,E,Post,Q13,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,They tried to give him pizza to eat he said he didnt like it and only ate 5 things.  Then he tried the pizza.  I dont remember what happened after that.  It wasnt really funny but im not sure if its supposed to be funny.  i remember they pu oil or water on the pizza and it was really soggy ive never seen anybody do that before
79,E,Post,Q13,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,Everyone in the break room was eating pizza. The guy on the left picked Gregory up a special pizza thinking he would eat it finally. The guy on the right picked up the pizza pretending to go and eat it then came clean and told everyone he doesn't like pizza. Everyone reacted dramatically to him not liking pizza.
80,E,Post,Q13,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,In this scene I believe the character was explain how he does not like a certain meal and the other characters were very shocked. I remember some of the characters were disappointed in the main characters opinions on not liking certain foods. I remember the white male character speaking most of the time. I believe in the end Gregory decides to skip out on the pizza.
84,E,Post,Q13,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,"Gregory admits he likes pizza, and proceeds to grab a piece of pizza with full intent to at it and full intent to consume it in it's entirety and defy any doubt that he likes pizza and dispel any earlier impressions to all concerned and present company, as he selects the slice with much delicacy. He looks on it with much desire."
86,E,Post,Q13,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,"They were giving the guy a hard time about not liking pizza. They then went on to talk about more eating habits, and why he didn’t bring that up to people ever. they made a big deal about it after that I don’t really remember much about what happened. He seemed to be very emotional about it, and they all started asking him a bunch of questions."
9,E,Post,Q13,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,They were talking about pizza and how he didn't like the type of pizza. They were in the break room during this time. He threw away the pizza and that's all I remember. They were all sitting together and one character couldn't believe that he didn't like the pizza.....................................
97,E,Post,Q13,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,The character touching the pizza above was admitting to his work peers that he does not like pizza. He was basically forced to admit this or eat the gross wet pizza. They had gone out of their way to get it for him after I guess he lied and said it was his favorite to avoid detection as a pizza hater.
6,C,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,"It was an episode of Abbot elementary where the main plot was about one of the teachers, Janine teaching the students how to step. This is made more complicated by the principal of the school taking an interest in her class and eventually taking it over. They eventually resolve their issues. With Janine realizing that she was judging and the principal becomes more responsible. There was also a subplot of the teacher bizarrely not like pizza and being a picky eater"
102,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,Jacob brought pizza in from various neighborhoods and what he thought was a favorite pizza place of Gregorys.  The other teachers loved the pizza and chose their favorites.  Everyone was shocked to learn Gregory do not like pizza.  He thinks it is weird.  He described it as crunchy and wet.  It is learned he is a picky eater.
111,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,"The man holding a the pizza is a very picky eater. He claims that he does not like pizza. His co-worker ordered a special type of pizza that he thinks the he will like ""extra wet from Baltimore"" in an attempt to convince him to eat pizza. He refuses to eat the pizza and the scene ends with the group of teachers talking about their favorite foods. The picky eater disagrees with all of their food affinities."
115,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,"They teachers are in a teachers lounge sharing pizza. They talk about how it’s the best.

19,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,"The younger guy brought in pizza for the teachers, and shared that he went to great lengths to get the type of pizza he thought Gregory likes. Gregory shared with the others that he doesn’t like pizza, after trying to hide that fact from them for a long time. They berated him for it, and he stood by his opinion."
35,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,"I wasn’t able to get this far in the session. They were having technical difficulties trying to set up my equipment, so I was only able to see the first show or a movie which was the town because I seem part of that or maybe it was part one that made a very familiar so that’s how I remember that, but I was unable to make it to this part of the session due totechnical difficulties"
4,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,Sorry but i really cannot remember the scene.  Gregory and Chris were discussing pizza and Gregory saying he did not like it but then was pursuaded into admitting that he really did... or something like that. But I may be confusing it with another episode i have seen since where everyone is eating donuts and discover they are from last school year.  But I am not sure
46,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,The teachers were at a lunch break and they were all eating pizza. One teacher wasn’t eating pizza and he said it’s because he only likes pizza from where he is from. Another teacher who is sucking up to the other teacher said he went all the way to get that teacher the pizza from where he is from. The teacher finally confessed he hates pizza and everyone ridiculed him.
51,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,"they were arguing about something delaing with lunch. The black guy was telling them what pizza he liked and the white guy, knowing this, had already bought his favorite pizza. But the black guy didn't want it after all. It was a boring scene. They were all talking about lunch for some reason. It seemed very unnatural and not funny. The acting was forced."
66,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,"Pizza was being eaten in the teacher's lounge. They were trying to get one of the teachers to eat pizza. He doesn't like pizza, so a debate was happening about pizza. The teacher explains why he doesn't like pizza. The others are explaining where the pizza was from. The piece he was doing to try was all soggy"
67,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,"After finding out that Gregory only likes a specific pizza, his co-worker was trying to be a great colleague by going to that certain restaurant to pick-up pizza for Gregory. Once he arrives at the teacher's lounge/cafeteria with the pizza, Gregory finally admits that does not like or eat pizza at all."
68,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,"The man on the right side of the photo was on a lunch break with the rest of the teachers. Everyone was eating pizza, except him. He tried taking slices and making excuses for why he wouldn’t eat the pizza, which led him to entirely confess that he strongly dislikes pizza. The two women in the room, as well as the man on the left side of the photo, all asked him why he didn’t like pizza. This became a small, playful argument that made the pizza disliked so uncomfortable that he wound up slinking out of the room."
72,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,The Abbott crew is eating pizza in the lunchroom. Gregory walks in and Jacob bring him a pizza that he drove two hours to get. It was a special pie that Gregory said was the only pizza he liked. Gregory tries to grab it but looks disgusted and ultimately confesses he just doesn’t like pizza. Everyone is horrified.
76,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,The guy sitting watching the guy grabbing the pizza had went out and grabbed pizza for everyone in the room but remembered that his friend grabbing the pizza only liked a certain type of pizza so he went out of his way to get what he liked and to find out the guy just really didn’t like any type of pizza so he said a pizza place that was far away never thinking someone would actually bring that pizza and catch him lying about liking pizza and have the truth come out that he didn’t like any pizza
91,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,The black guy did not like pizza. He told his friend he did not like pizza. But his friend kept on pushing and pushing to try it. But he reluctantly tried it to placate the other guy. Still he did not like it.  He just finally had to say no. There was some tension. But they are fiends so no big deal.
92,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,The actor opposite the main actor offered him Pizza and then the other guy refused to take it so the actor offering the pizza made fun of him for not liking it. It wasn't really funny to me at all. I mean I really couldn't get into it because the comedy just wasn't appealing to me. I would have rather watch something else
94,D,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Abbot Elementary,What happened in the scene was the teacher went out his way to buy Gregory a pizza from his hometown. He said he drove hours to get the pizza to him. And he doesn’t like pizza. And Gregory felt awkward confuse. And the teacher was dumbfounded. he said I just don’t know what it is. I don’t like pizza.

104,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,Nothing really helped my understanding because I didn't understand it to begin with.
106,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,The suspense and excitement kept my attention and help me understand what was going on.
116,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,Having seen clip previously helped my understanding and seeing mad max movies
14,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,"Being well rested and not being distracted. The tone, quality, and voice was very clear."
3,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,Afterwards I had to go back and read the premise of the movie again and the other movies part of the franchise to understand the whole story.
52,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,"Paying close attention to who was who's enemy/friend. Without watching the entirety from the beginning, I can see how that may be somewhat confusing."
55,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,It was the overall action scenes that helped me understand what was happening. It was the switch between scenes that gave me an idea of what was happening and how I could make a better inference of what was happening in the scene.
8,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,"I think the length of the clip helped. However, i didn't understand the motivations behind the chase. I gathered from the makeup who the ""bad guys"" were."
81,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,Nothing in particular. I understood it by watching it but it was a lot of commotion so I couldn’t remember details about this scene.
83,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,It seemed that the blood drinkers eventually destroyed the spike vehicles that posed an even greater threat to Furiosa
98,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,"The distinctive nature of the silver spray paint scene, the distinctive looking vehicles with spikes and other weapons, and the exciting nature of the scene."
99,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,"I remember seeing parts of the film before, so I managed to piece together a little bit of information."
107,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,Well all the action scenes that were portrayed with great emotion and the music in the back ground helped as well
109,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,The emotions and excitement of the characters. Furiosa and her bandits were excited
11,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,Nothing helped for this scene. I just remember them driving the cars and the explosions
113,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,"I remember watching the movie when it was released a few years ago. And the actress, Charlize Theron is one of my favorites."
117,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,"It was very action packed so my eyes were glued to the screen, but I was also trying to figure out what was even going on."
17,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,"I understood what was happening due to the clear imagery of the scene, but it was hard to figure out at first because there wasn't a lot of dialogue and the scene was not one that is typical of our world or daily lives."
41,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,it was very clear what was happening and it was very intense. I even thought for a second they would crash so I was really paying attention. There was a lot of action a lot of movements and I was trying to follow along.
42,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,"It was a simple car chase so even with the given context, it wasn’t too hard to understand."
44,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,You see him explode immediately after making contact and the entire crew cheers him on afterwards.
50,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,The scene was cut fast. There was a lot of movement from the protagonist to the antagonists. There was a lot of action. But it was clear that a battle was going on for supremacy.
60,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,Just having earlier knowlegde of Mad Max movies. Mad Max has been around for a long time
70,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,NOTHING IT WAS BORING .  I DID NOT FIND THE MOVIE INTERESTING. I WILL NOT WATCH IT AGAIN EVER.
85,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,I remember the desert landscape and this being from mad max. I remember the white face men.
96,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionHelp,Short,Mad Max,"I have seen this movie previously, so I knew what was happening already"
104,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,More context. It just seemed like an ultra violent scene for the sake of ultra violence and I didn't understand why and what was happening
106,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,"A longer clip would provide more context. Why were they running away, what were they protecting, who was the man, etc"
116,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,It would have helped my understanding to watch the clip longer. Possibly more of the clip in the beginning and more of the clip at the end.
3,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,I forgot the context of the movie who furiousa and the guy were and why the 2 different groups were trying to kill each other.
52,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,"Watching the movie in full from the very beginning. I never seen the original Mad Max, and this one looks fantastic. Great effects!"
55,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,I felt like the scene was moving so fast with all the action that it was hard for me to tell what was happening in the scene. I felt like some of scenes should have happened a little slower or even in slow motion. So that way I could tell what was happening besides the action packed scenes.
8,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,"The plot was not very easy to follow. There was very little or no dialogue between the characters. Furthermore, I was not very invested in the characters."
81,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,Nothing in particular. I understood it by watching it but it was a lot of commotion so I couldn’t remember details about this scene.
83,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,It was really unclear as to why the blood drinkers were pursuing Furiosa and her rig
99,A,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,Having more context to the scene. I was a bit confused as to why they were getting chased and who was chasing the rig.
11,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,Maybe having more diologe between the character s and probably watching the whole movie that way I was not lost and knew what was going on. There was just way too much action for me
117,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,"If I knew what was happening, such as what the creatures were, names, what the rig was, and if this was even taking place on Earth."
42,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,"The scene was kind of in the middle of something thrilling so I didn’t really get what was going on in terms of context, so I guess just more background information might’ve helped."
60,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,I think seeing the entire movie would help in that area. It is one of the Mad Max movies and in someways a clip for one is similar to a clip from another.
70,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,NOTHING. I DO NOT WANT TO WATCH IT AGAIN  BOORRING. I HATE EXPLOSIVES AND THE DESERT.  NOT MY CUP OF TEA.
85,F,Post,Q20-1,ComprehensionImprove,Short,Mad Max,I felt I was tired and tuned out during this scene due to the high action.
104,A,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,They were fighting other people in the deserts of Australia and I wasn't sure who was the good guy in the bad guy but everybody was driving with vehicles that had mysterious in strange weapons and people were getting run off the road. It was a remake from the original movie that I saw but I never saw this one and I remember I might want to watch it.
106,A,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"There was a chase of a car caravan. People were attacking the caravan and bald white painted people were defending by jumping onto the cars and sacrificing themselves. The main character was a woman. Another man was strapped to the front of the car for some reason. I think they were attacking the truck because of the ""water wars""."
116,A,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,This is a high speed chase scene from the movie mad max furry road. The actor jumps from his vehicle with his spears and kills the actor driving the car. The man who is chained to the car is not injuried. Furiosa and her crew successfully protect their rig and drive away. This is what I can remember about the scene.
14,A,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"In this post apocalyptical wasteland fuel and machines are instruments of war between waring factions. The buzzards control their area and lay traps for would be passers by. A fight of spikes, motocross, and hamade lance bombs ensues. The rig driver Furiosa is extremely competent and seriously capable to multitask defense with driving."
3,A,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"The two different groups were fighting each other. The group in the back had someone hostage and were trying to take down the big truck group in the front. The character jumping with the arrows had gotten shot with arrows so was already dying, so risked their life and was successful at blowing up another car/group that was trying to attack."
52,A,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"The man in the air holding the 2 spears was about to blow up the car below him, knowing he'd be killed for the success of his team/people. This scene was really exciting. Many quick kills. So much happening at once. Thrilling! I've never seen this movie in full, but I will in the near future. Thanks for the suggestion!"
55,A,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,This was a scene that showed many post-apocalyptic people and vehicles in a chase to catch up with one another to kill their enemies. It was filled with spiked vehicles and weaponized vehicles that were used to chase and kill one another. The main character who is the woman in charge was trying to save her friend from being slaughtered by these monsters.
8,A,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,There was a man who was on a vehicle and the other characters were attempting to eject him from it. I believe the man in the mask was Tom hardy. There were flame throwers and guns blazing as they sped through the desert. There were lots of explosions. Charlize Theron was in the film. There was a spiked vehicle.
81,A,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,I honestly can’t recall. I do recall that  there was some people chasing another group of people and they are in a shoot out. A guy kills himself trying to kill the other group of people. He succeeded in killing a few peoples when he let off the bombs as he jumped at them. That’s all I can recall honestly.
83,A,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,The guys who tied Mad Max to the pole on the front of their car were trying to blow up the vehicles with the spikes because the spiked vehicles were trying to kill them This was one of the last scenes in a long chase scene where several spiked vehicles as well as many of the captors' vehicles had been destroyed.
98,A,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"The tanker truck full of gas is ambushed by a roaming group of marauders who attack their convoy with vehicles armed with spikes, bombs and other weapons. The marauders have a hostage from the original tanker convoy strapped to the front of their car. The truck convoy manages to fight off the group of marauders. In this particular scene, one of them (unclear which side) sprays his mouth with silver spray paint then jumps off the truck with two bombs onto one of the marauders."
99,A,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"There is a chase scene involving Furiosa's crew trying to protect the rig and another group of people. Some of the crew are killed, and there are lots of explosions as they protect the rig. One of Furiosa's men gets hit with an arrow, and it pierces his body and part of his neck. He sprays some silver liquid and it heals him. He then sacrifices himself by jumping on one of the other group's car, resulting in an explosion. Everyone cheers."
107,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"I can’t recollect characters names off the top of my head. But the pale guys are traveling with fuel/supplies to take back to their main city. And then all of a sudden bandits came out of no where and tried taking over their convoy. There was a lot of action such as speeding, shooting and explosions."
109,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,The scene took place in the sand dessert where war rigs and crews were attempting to destroy one another and Furiosa was driving the war rig and one of her bandits jumped onto another war rig and detonated an explosive. They celebrated as they screamed and yelled while pumping their fists in the air.
11,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,To be honest I don’t remember to much. They were driving in a car and a bunch of other people were driving beside them and trying to kill someone I think. It wasn’t too clear there was not a lot of diologe in the scene. It was mainly just a lot of explosions and racing scenes. I didn’t find it enjoyable and can’t remember particular details
113,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"This is the confrontation between Imperator Furiosa and  Immortan Joe after Furiosa has led  a brazen escape with Joe's five wives. They try to escape but the warlord catches up with them, and a mighty battle ensues. They survive the battle due to the armored truck that provides them with protection."
117,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"They were driving these Arena war trucks and cars in the middle of the desert. Then they were ambushed by these non-human creatures, and they had to defend their truck from multiple cars. There were a lot of cannon shots and explosives. There was also a guy strapped to one of the enemy's cars, possibly a hostage, had that the main truck was trying to save as he was a human."
17,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"The scene was a post-apocalyptic car chase through the desert. A bunch of scavenger-like characters were chasing the main character, and they also had a man hostage who the main character seemed to know. Lots of crashing and explosions and spears and cars made out of random salvaged items. There was a lot going on in this scene."
41,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"I remember the woman Furiosa speeding anddriving and everyone else fighting off everyone who was chasing them, including the guy in the passenger seat.They were driving at high speed. It was getting violent. They were fighting back. There was a lot of excitement, a lot of action and intensity. I remember they had someone hostage and everyone was fighting back against each other. It was definitely a nailbiter."
42,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"It looked like there’s some sort of chase going on between two factions and there was a lady driving one of the cars who I guess was in charge of the one faction and there were these other humanoid things involved. In the chasing faction, there was a man tied to the front of a car, and the people being pursued were blowing up some of the cars in pursuit, and at one point some guy jumped from the main truck and sacrificed himself to blow up another car, after eating some white spray paint stuff."
44,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"A bunch of guys are attacking each other in the desert and this guy decides to jump off his car and make the ultimate sacrifice. There's another guy tied to the front of the car watching all this happen and he seems to be a hostage. The sacrificer, explodes right after making contact with the car he's jumping on and takes out the enemy. With his comrades and friends cheering on his sacrifice. Super fun scene, very exciting and action packed."
50,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"Max, a wanderer in post-apocalyptic Australia, is strapped to the front of a war vehicle. He is used as a prop and a source of blood as the War Boys attack a tanker. In this scene, one of the warriors is launching a defense against his attackers. The battle takes place at high speed among various modified vehicles."
60,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"Durinmg the Mad Max race the each group wanted something. In this scene that guy flying through the air was attacking the other group, however it was in a very dramatic way ast he flew off the top of one vehicle to the other. Driving the spears into the challengers. The two gangs are at war with each other,"
70,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"I DO NOT KNOW I DID NOT LIKE MAD MAX MOVIE, SO I DO NOT LIKE THE SCENES.  THEY WERE ALWAYS TRYING TO KILL SOMEONE. Something was always blowing up.
It was boring.  I DO NOT REMEMBER THE CHARACTERS THEY ALWAYS SHOWED SOMETHING BLOWING UP AND THEY WERE IN UGLY VEHICLES WITH UGLY COSTUMES.
I DID NOT LIKE IT AT ALL. NOT MY FAVORITE.  IT IS NOT LIKE THEY SAID THE CHARACTERS NAMES."
85,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"This is from mad max, I have seen the movie before and remember this scene in the movie. I tend to kind of tune out sometimes in high action scenes. This is the guys with white faces who spray themselves in the mouth before they die, I think they are bad guys and were chasing Charlize Theron’s character in the scene."
96,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"In this scene, Furiosa is being chased in her truck by a bunch of people trying to kill her and her men. Simultaneously, Tom Hardy has been kidnapped and is tied to a post on the front of the truck that is seen in this image. The scene flashes back and forth to the different cars driving and trying to get to Furiosa's truck. In this specific picture, the guy who is in the air has been shot with an arrow, so he decides to sacrifice himself to take out the spikey truck in the back of the picture."
