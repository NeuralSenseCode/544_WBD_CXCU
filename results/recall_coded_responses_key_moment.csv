They quickly noticed the driver had left the front seat and then heard the cops showing up so had to all get back into the car and then a speed chase with the Boston police began.,"The participant recalls the robbery, money being loaded, noticing the driver missing, and the police chase. However, they omit several key moments such as the disguises, the guard's resistance and shooting, the car switch, and the burning of the minivan. The sequence is partially correct but lacks specificity and completeness.",85,60

Chaos unfold,"The participant recalls the crew driving to the location, waiting for the armored truck, and robbing it, which matches the initial MODEL EVENTS.

With Janine realizing that she was judging and the principal becomes more responsible. There was also a subplot of the teacher bizarrely not like pizza and being a picky eater","The participant recognizes the subplot about a teacher not liking pizza and being a picky eater, which is the core of the key moment. However, they do not mention any of the specific events, such as Gregory's confession, the staff's reactions, or the comedic details. The recall is general and lacks specificity.",95,30

There was a spiked vehicle.,"The participant recalls the presence of spiked vehicles, explosions, and desert combat, which aligns with the general chaos of the battle. However, they focus on characters not central to the key moment (Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron) and do not mention the War Boy suicide attack or the Buzzards, resulting in only partial recall of the key events.",85,50
20,8,A,Post,Q13,Recall,Long,The Town,This was a robbery scene in the film. The three people involved pulled off the heist and were trying to evade capture. Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner starred in the film. They did shoot a security guard from the armored car.  They eventually went to a side street and then jumped into another car that was the getaway vehicle. They left hair collected from a barber shop in the car they abandoned and set it on fire.,"The participant recalls the robbery, the shooting of a guard, the escape to a side street, switching to a second getaway car, and setting the abandoned car on fire, which matches events 8, 18-22.

So someone went to buy it for him but it turns out he was lying and he doesn’t like pizza in general. They were discussing how he doesn’t like pizza and that can’t be possible,"The participant accurately recalls that Gregory lied about liking a specific style of pizza (Baltimore-style), that someone went to get it for him, and that he ultimately admits he doesn't like pizza. However, the response omits key details such as the group’s reaction, the dramatic mop drop, the extended teasing, and Gregory’s explanation about being a picky eater. The ordering and main beats are correct, but the recall lacks specificity and completeness.",90,60
150,11,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,To be honest I don’t remember to much. They were driving in a car and a bunch of other people were driving beside them and trying to kill someone I think.

Long police chase and I think they got away.","The participant remembers a guard outside, a robbery, chaos, a police chase, and a shootout, which matches the ambush, resistance, police pursuit, and gunfire.

The buzzards control their area and lay traps for would be passers by. A fight of spikes, motocross, and hamade lance bombs ensues. The rig driver Furiosa is extremely competent and seriously capable to multitask defense with driving.","The response identifies the Buzzards, the use of traps, and the ensuing battle involving spikes and 'lance bombs,' as well as Furiosa's defensive driving.

The first teacher gets upset and the Second Lady gets more involved and the episode ends with a step show during a school event and the second teacher leaves right before the show leaving the students without the ability to show their dance to the school.
