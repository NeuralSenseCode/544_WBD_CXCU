Then the teacher got all emotional because others got on him about not liking pizza and he went to go eat food in his car alone.",60.0,"The participant correctly recalls the teachers mocking Gregory for not liking pizza, his invention of a detailed lie about 'Baltimore-style' pizza, and the emotional fallout. They also mention the pizza being described as crispy and soggy, which matches the model.

The first teacher gets upset and the Second Lady gets more involved and the episode ends with a step show during a school event and the second teacher leaves right before the show leaving the students without the ability to show their dance to the school.

The response includes the group's surprise and the pizza tasting event, but omits many details (names, specific actions, and the full sequence of events).
