In the chasing faction, there was a man tied to the front of a car, and the people being pursued were blowing up some of the cars in pursuit, and at one point some guy jumped from the main truck and sacrificed himself to blow up another car, after eating some white spray paint stuff."

There's another guy tied to the front of the car watching all this happen and he seems to be a hostage. The sacrificer, explodes right after making contact with the car he's jumping on and takes out the enemy. With his comrades and friends cheering on his sacrifice. Super fun scene, very exciting and action packed."

70,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"I DO NOT KNOW I DID NOT LIKE MAD MAX MOVIE, SO I DO NOT LIKE THE SCENES.  THEY WERE ALWAYS TRYING TO KILL SOMEONE. Something was always blowing up.
It was boring.  I DO NOT REMEMBER THE CHARACTERS THEY ALWAYS SHOWED SOMETHING BLOWING UP AND THEY WERE IN UGLY VEHICLES WITH UGLY COSTUMES.
I DID NOT LIKE IT AT ALL. NOT MY FAVORITE.  IT IS NOT LIKE THEY SAID THE CHARACTERS NAMES."
85,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"This is from mad max, I have seen the movie before and remember this scene in the movie. I tend to kind of tune out sometimes in high action scenes. This is the guys with white faces who spray themselves in the mouth before they die, I think they are bad guys and were chasing Charlize Theron’s character in the scene."
96,F,Post,Q18,Recall,Short,Mad Max,"In this scene, Furiosa is being chased in her truck by a bunch of people trying to kill her and her men. Simultaneously, Tom Hardy has been kidnapped and is tied to a post on the front of the truck that is seen in this image. The scene flashes back and forth to the different cars driving and trying to get to Furiosa's truck. In this specific picture, the guy who is in the air has been shot with an arrow, so he decides to sacrifice himself to take out the spikey truck in the back of the picture."
